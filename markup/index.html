			<h2>What is Query2JSON?</h2>
			<div class="text">
				Query2JSON solves a very simply problem and is a quick and easy way. Several services (i.e. Twilio) use RESTlike webhooks for reacting to incoming data. These services make requests like this.
			</div>
			<div class="blob">
				http://www.yourwebsite.com/callback?cat=hat&fish=stick
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				This works fine if you're writing a custom application, but sometimes you need to "glue" the data from this service into another service or database host (i.e. Firebase). Some of these services expect requests like this. 
			</div>
			<div class="blob">
				http://www.secondservice.com/youraccount/<br />
				-> {"cat": "hat", "fish":"stick"}
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				Query2JSON solves this little incompatibility by providing a way to translate the request without running your own server. A request with Query2JSON works like this. 
			</div>
			<div class="blob">
				http://www.query2json.com/{ID}?cat=hat&fish=stick<br />
				<div class="text light">[Query2JSON Translates Request]</div>
				http://www.secondservice.com/youraccount/<br />
				-> {"cat": "hat", "fish":"stick"}
